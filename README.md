# AfriText Exchange 

A student peer-to-peer textbook marketplace for Android, built to help South African higher education students buy and sell second-hand textbooks affordably.


## About the App

AfriText Exchange connects students within the same institution, allowing them to list textbooks they no longer need and browse listings from other students. The app replaces informal methods like WhatsApp groups and notice boards with a dedicated, structured mobile platform that is easy to use and built with the South African student in mind.

This project was developed as part of the **MADA372 – Mobile Application Development A** module at **STADIO School of Information Technology**.
